#  Nobel Laureate - Histogram

In this project, we are focused at using **Histogram for Data Vizualization**. Histograms measure the distribution of data within defined ranges. So we are **calculating laureate age and creating bins of equal sizes**. Then we are looking at laureate age by prize category. 

In this project we are following the below steps.

- Load Data from Web to Power BI and Transform it. 
- Creating bin of equal sizes for laureate age. 
- **Creating Histogram for looking at laugeate age by prize category**
- Using **smart narrative** for adding key information related to the data.
